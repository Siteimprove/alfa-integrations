# Changelog

All notable changes to Alfa will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and Alfa adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

<details>
<summary><strong>Guidelines for writing changelog entries</strong></summary>

The changelog includes a single entry for every released version of Alfa. Each entry is identified by two pieces of information: The version number and the date, in [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format, of the release. The very first entry in the changelog, labelled `[Unreleased]`, includes all upcoming changes for inclusion in the next release.

Each entry may begin with a general description of the changes introduced in the release and must then list each notable change as separate list items. For each item, the following should be included:

- The name of the package affected, as the first point in the item: `[@siteimprove/alfa-<package>](packages/alfa-<package>): <description>`. If more than one package is affected, the package names must be separated by a comma.

- The issue and/or pull request that concerns the change, as the last point in the item and enclosed by parentheses: `<description> ([#<number>](../../issues/<number>))`. If more than one reference is needed, the references must be separated by a comma. All references must be within the same set of parentheses.

Items that are related, such as breaking changes, new features, or changes to existing features, should be grouped under an appropriate heading.

**Note on links:** For all links to repository resources rooted at `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>`, make sure to use paths relative to `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob` which is the path from which GitHub [performs autolinking](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-readmes#relative-links-and-image-paths-in-readme-files). This helps keeps links short and ensures that they are not tied to a specific owner and repository name in the event that we should move and/or rename the repository. Also, please refrain from using [shortcut reference links](https://github.github.com/gfm/#shortcut-reference-link) as they make it difficult to copy/paste entries to outside the changelog.
