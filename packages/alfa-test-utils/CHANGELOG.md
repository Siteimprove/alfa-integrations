# @siteimprove/alfa-test-utils

## 0.74.2

### Patch Changes

- **Changed:** Update Alfa ([#100](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa-integrations/pull/100))

## 0.74.1

### Patch Changes

- **Changed:** Update Alfa ([#99](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa-integrations/pull/99))

## 0.74.0

### Minor Changes

- **Added:** `SIP.upload` can now be called without an user email or APIâ€¯key, in which case it will return an `Err`. ([#96](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa-integrations/pull/96))

  That can nonetheless be passed to `Logging.fromAudit` which will then simply discard it. This makes it simpler to write tests without checking proactively the presence of the credentials and, e.g., run them both in environments where they are available and environments where they don't exist.

- **Breaking:** `Logging.prepare` and `Logging.result` have been replaced by `Logging.fromAudit` and `Logging#print`. ([#96](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa-integrations/pull/96))

  Migration: replace the `Logging.result(Logging.prepare(audit), pageReportUrl)` calls with `Logging.fromAudit(audit, pageReportUrl).print()`.

- **Breaking:** The `Audit.Result` type has been renamed to `Audit`. ([#96](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa-integrations/pull/96))

  Migration: simply use `Audit` type wherever the `Audit.Result` type was used.

### Patch Changes

- **Changed:** Update Alfa ([#98](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa-integrations/pull/98))

- **Added:** An `Audit#toJSON` serialisation is now available. ([#96](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa-integrations/pull/96))

- **Added:** `Logging.fromAudit` also accepts an `Audit.JSON` input. ([#96](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa-integrations/pull/96))

- **Added:** The audit and report functionalities can now be imported separately. ([#96](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa-integrations/pull/96))

  This resolves a problem where logging functionalities, highly depending on node, would crash bundlers and injections into other Javascript worlds when trying to import the full `@siteimprove/alfa-test-utils` package.

## 0.73.4

### Patch Changes

- **Changed:** Update Alfa ([#95](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa-integrations/pull/95))

## 0.73.3

### Patch Changes

- **Changed:** Update Alfa ([#94](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa-integrations/pull/94))

## 0.73.2

### Patch Changes

- **Changed:** Update Alfa and yarn ([#87](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa-integrations/pull/87))

## 0.73.1

### Patch Changes

- **Changed:** Content inside `<iframe>` is not checked anymore by default. ([#81](https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa-integrations/pull/81))

  This is often third party content, or separate pages that can be checked individually, hence it often makes less sense to re-check it as part of the full page.

  If you want to include `<ifrme>` content in the reports, pass the `{ outcomes: { includeIframe: true } }` to `Audit.run`. Content of `<iframe>` will nonetheless not be displayed in the Siteimprove Intelligence Platform Page Report, even if the uploaded result contains it.

### Minor Changes

  - a wrapper to upload audit results to the Siteimprove Intelligence Platform and see them in the Page Report;
  - a helper to run an audit, selecting rules to use and outcomes to keep;
  - a collection of filters to select the rules to run in the audit;
  - a collection of filters to select the outcomes to keep in the audit.
