## Performance.Durations type

Records the duration of resolving the CSS cascade, building the accessibility tree, and running each rule.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type Durations = {
        common: CommonDurations;
        rules: RulesDurations;
    };
```
**References:** [RulesDurations](./alfa-test-utils.performance.rulesdurations.md)

## Remarks

The cascade and accessibility tree are cached, so we store their performance separately to avoid unfairly "charging" the first rule to use and build them.
